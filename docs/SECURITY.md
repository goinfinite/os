# Security Policies

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates only for the latest version of Infinite OS. In case of a critical vulnerability, we will not backport the fix to the previous version. We recommend that you redeploy your application with the latest version available of Infinite OS. That way you will always have the latest security updates and features from Infinite OS and also the underlying operating system.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security at Infinite very seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to inform us responsibly.

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to us at eng _at_ goinfinite.net (do not use this email for support questions). You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.
